# EyeWitness User App

This App is built to provide a platform to report crime **anonymously**. The report directly goes to **nearest** policeman/station.
No information of the user(eye witness) is stored in any of the database. App provides a hassle free three click reporting. UI is made super simple to help all the users. The app uses **Google Maps** API and **Firebase** for smooth functioning.

The whole project contains 4 levels : 

- User level
- Task Force level
- Supervision level
- Head level

Every level has a seperate app of its own. All the apps are connected through a **central database**.
